Introductory Mathematica notebook(s).

## `.nb` vs `.wl`

**Most of you will just want to [download `intro.nb`][nb].**
`.nb` is the standard Mathematica notebook format.

If you're like me and into version control,
you will want to [download `intro.wl`][wl].
I prefer `.wl` because *only* the input cells are saved.
Output cells and notebook metadata are not saved.
This means that

1. Raw `.wl` files are a lot more readable than `.nb` files
   (compare [`intro.wl`](intro.wl) with [`intro.nb`](intro.nb))
2. You can sensibly edit a `.wl` file in any plaintext editor
3. You can sensibly do version control with `.wl` files.
